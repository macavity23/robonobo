robonobo readme
---------------

Welcome to robonobo.  To run the program, execute the provided shell script 
'robonobo', which runs java with the right arguments and the robonobo jar
file.  Depending on your system, you may have to make this file executable:

chmod 755 robonobo

If you want to move this jarfile somewhere else, you will need to update 
the shell script to point to the new jar location.
