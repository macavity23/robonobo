robonobo source readme
----------------------

Welcome to robonobo, an open source p2p music streaming & downloading application.

Quick:
$ cd gui
$ ant clean fatjar
$ java -jar target/dist/robonobo-*.jar

Each directory is an eclipse project, or else you can run things from ant as you see above.
For the ui, look in the gui project, main class com.robonobo.Robonobo
For the core functionality - transferring files around, managing users and playlists, playing music - look in the core project, main class com.robobobo.core.RobonoboController
For the lowish level broadcasting and receiving of data in streams, look in the mina project, main class com.robonobo.mina.instance.MinaInstance
For the tcp-like network stack that does data throttling, look in the eon project, you'll probably want to look at all of it :-)
For the currency, look in wang-client for the client end, and wang-server for the bank end
For the centralised web-based bits that bootstrap the rbnb network and provide stream metadata, see sonar-webapp and midas-webapp
For os-specific stuff, creating installers and packages, etc, look in dist
