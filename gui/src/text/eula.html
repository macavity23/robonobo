<h1>IMPORTANT LEGAL STUFF - please read carefully!</h1>
<h1>Alpha/Beta Testing Legal Notice</h1>
<p>robonobo is a music sharing program, and is currently under development.  Most parts of the application remain unfinished, and all parts may change at any time as development continues.</p>
<p>An essential part of the finished version of robonobo is an audio fingerprinting algorithm that allows artists and rights holders to stop unauthorised copying of copyrighted material.  Once this algorithm is properly implemented, the software will protect you from legal liability by not sharing any copyrighted materials over the network.</p>
<p><b>Note that this algorithm is not yet finished</b>.  This means that depending on the legal system in your country of residence, you could be liable for civil and/or criminal penalties if you share copyrighted music using robonobo.  Therefore, when using the alpha or beta testing versions of robonobo (of which this is one) you should only share music that is made freely available by the artist, or music that you own the copyrights to yourself.  If in doubt, do not share the music using robonobo.</p>
<p>By accepting this agreement and using robonobo, you agree to take on all legal responsibility for any copyrighted materials that you share.  The robonobo developers accept no liability for the files you share.  If you are in any doubt as to your legal situation, select 'Cancel' below and take legal counsel.</p>
