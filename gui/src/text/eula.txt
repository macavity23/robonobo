Alpha/Beta Testing Legal Notice
==========================
robonobo is a music sharing program, and is currently under development.  Most 
parts of the application remain unfinished, and all parts may change at any 
time as development continues.

An essential part of the finished version of robonobo is an audio 
fingerprinting algorithm that allows artists and rights holders to stop 
unauthorised copying of copyrighted material.  Once this algorithm is properly 
implemented, the software will protect you from legal liability by not sharing 
any copyrighted materials over the network.

Note that this algorithm is not yet finished.  This means that depending on the 
legal system in your country of residence, you could be liable for civil and/or 
criminal penalties if you share copyrighted music using robonobo.  Therefore, 
when using the alpha or beta testing versions of robonobo (of which this is 
one), you should only share music that is made freely available by the artist, 
or music that you own the copyrights to yourself.  If in doubt, do not share 
the music using robonobo.

By accepting this agreement and using robonobo, you agree to take on all legal 
responsibility for any copyrighted materials that you share.  The robonobo 
developers accept no liability for the files you share.  If you are in any 
doubt as to your legal situation, type 'cancel' at the robonobo command prompt,
and take legal counsel.
