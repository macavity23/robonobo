<h1>Dlugosz' Variable-Length Integer Encoding — Revision 2</h1>

<h1 style="color: red;">NOTE: this doc was originally from http://www.dlugosz.com/ZIP2/VLI.html but has been changed as the byte thresholds in the original doc are wrong!</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Since the whole idea of the ZIP2 file format is to save room, it is
wasteful to store values with a larger number of bytes when a small
number is generally enough. Also, since it is designed with the future
in mind, what is the upper limit of the value's size? For example, 32
bits might be a good choice for a length value now, but insufficient in
the near future. So it is natural that many integer values will be
stored as variable-sized integers. It will be short when possible,
keeping the file efficient. However, it may be long when necessary.</p>

<p>My first idea was to simply use UTF-8 encoding.  However, this is less 
efficient for small integers than it could be (two byte forms only goes up to 
2K) and is limited to handling numbers up to 31 bits.  A design goal was to 
handle 64 bits, so this would not do.</p>

<p>Since I was looking for something different anyway, it became clear that the 
design considerations for UTF-8 were simply not applicable for my needs.  A 
simpler format would work quite well, and offer other benefits in exchange.</p>

<h2>History and Previous Versions</h2>

<p>Version 1 of this idea used a very simple and elegant approach, where an n-
byte field contained n-1 1-bits, a 0-bit, and finally 7*n bits making up the 
number.  This proved more difficult than anticipated to implement efficiently 
in Perl, and has the disadvantage of not knowing how many bytes you need to 
read from a stream before you know the length.</p>

<p>Version 2 is totally revised, but has some features in common.  It further 
optimizes some common number ranges, and makes reading from a stream easier.</p>

<p>It can't be explained in a sentence anymore, but requires some tables.  But, 
real implementations used tables anyway, so it's not actually more difficult 
to program.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The first byte of the variable-length field will indicate how long the field 
is, and may contain some bits of the value.  Subsequent bytes contain the 
rest of the number's value.  In addition, there is a super-extended form that 
encodes the length in the second (or more) bytes, but this is not needed 
except for very large multi-precision integers.</p>

<p>In all cases, masking off the highest bits will leave the value readable in 
big-endian format in the field, once you know the field's length (which is 
encoded in those high bits).</p>

<p>A byte with its high bit cleared is a one-byte value, holding a number from 0-
127.  If the high bit is set, the next highest bit indicates that the value 
is two bytes long when clear, longer when set.</p>

<p>So a two-byte value can hold up to 16K, which is sufficient for ordinals most 
of the time.  A 4-byte value can hold up to 128 Meg, which is sufficient for 
most length values.  If you're storing files longer than that, an extra byte 
for a longer length field is not significant.</p>

<p>Longer fields still have less than 1 byte of overhead to encode the length.  
A 64-bit Windows FILETIME really has 57 bits for current time values, and 
that will still encode to a 8-byte field (5 bits overhead for the length).</p>

<p>There are 4 unused encodings with 1 byte of overhead, and they can be 
assigned to optimize cases for common needs, as they are discovered.  For 
more arbitrary storage, a final form gives the length as a separate value, 
and can encode any length.</p>

<h2>Benifits and Features</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Efficient encoding keeps the values short most of the time.
	</li><li>Easy to decode, compared to UTF-8.  Rather than extracting some bits from 
each byte and shifting them into position, the value can be read simply by 
masking off the high bits.
	</li><li>The algorithm extends to integers of arbitrary size.
</li></ul>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>There are four general forms.  The shortest preserve minimum size and maximum 
range for ordinal values.  They have n= 0, 1, or 2 leading 1 bits followed by 
a 0 bit, followed by n additional bytes.</p>

<p>The second format has 3 leading 1 bits, followed by a 2-bit selector.  The 
selector encodes for 3, 4 or 7 additional bytes.</p>

<p>When the selector is binary 11, the rest of the byte encodes a 3-bit selector 
that encodes more lengths.</p>

<p>When that selector is binary 111, the length follows the first byte.  The 
length is itself encoded as a VLI.  That is followed by that many value bytes.</p>

<p>
<span class="bit">[0 xxxxxxx]</span> holds 0—127 in one byte.</p>
<p>The first bit is zero, indicating this form.  The remaining 7 bits hold the 
value.</p>

<p>
<span class="bit">[10 xxxxxx] [yyyyyyyy]</span> holds 0—16,383 in two 
bytes.</p>
<p>The first two bits are <span class="bit">10</span>, indicating this form.  
The remaining 6 <span class="bit">x</span> bits are the most-significant bits 
of the value, and the second byte is the least-significant 8 bits of the value.
</p>

<p>If you mask off the first two bits (set them both to zero for an unsigned 
vli), the two bytes will hold the value in big-endian.</p>

<p><span class="bit">[110 xxxxx] [yyyyyyyy] [zzzzzzzz]</span> holds 
0—2,097,151 in three bytes.</p>
<p>The first three bits are <span class="bit">110</span>, indicating this form.
The remaining 5 <span class="bit">x</span> bits are the most-significant bits 
of the value, followed by two more bytes of value.</p>

<p><span class="bit">[111 ff xxx] [[ n bytes ]]</span></p>
<p>The first three bits are <span class="bit">110</span>, indicating this form.
The following two <span class="bit">f</span> bits encode the length.  The 
remaining 3 <span class="bit">x</span> bits are the most-significant bits 
of the value, followed by the specified number of additional value bytes.
</p>

<p>Values of <span class="bit">ff</span> encode:  <span class="bit">00</span> = 3 
more bytes (27 bits of value total), <span class="bit">01</span> = 4 more bytes 
(35 bits total), <span class="bit">10</span> =7 more bytes (59 bits total), and <span class="bit">11</span> means to use the even longer <span class="bit">g</span> 
format.</p>

<p>These are listed individually below.</p>

<p><span class="bit">[111 00 xxx] [[ 3 bytes ]]</span> holds 0—128K in 4 
bytes.<br>
<span class="bit">[111 01 xxx] [[ 4 bytes ]]</span> holds a 35-bit value.<br>
<span class="bit">[111 10 xxx] [[ 7 bytes ]]</span> holds a 59-bit value.</p>

<p><span class="bit">[111 11 ggg] [[ n bytes ]]</span></p>
<p>The first five bits are <span class="bit">11111</span>, indicating this form.
The following three <span class="bit">g</span> bits encode the length.  This 
is followed by the indicated number of value bytes.</p>

<p>Values of <span class="bit">ggg</span> encode:  <span class="bit">000</span> 
= 5 more bytes, <span class="bit">001</span> = 8 more bytes, <span class="bit">010</span> = 16 more bytes, and <span class="bit">111</span> means to use the even longer <span class="bit">v</span> 
format.  The other 4 values of <span class="bit">ggg</span> are reserved for 
future definition.</p>

<p><span class="bit">[111 11 000] [[ 5 bytes ]]</span><br>
<span class="bit">[111 11 001] [[ 8 bytes ]]</span><br>
<span class="bit">[111 11 010] [[ 16 bytes ]]</span><br>
<span class="bit">[111 11 011] [[ ??? ]]</span> is reserved<br>
<span class="bit">[111 11 100] [[ ??? ]]</span> is reserved<br>
<span class="bit">[111 11 101] [[ ??? ]]</span> is reserved<br>
<span class="bit">[111 11 110] [[ ??? ]]</span> is reserved<br>
<span class="bit">[111 11 111] [[ v-field ]] [[ lots more bytes]]</span>
</p>


<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>Example numbers are written with a leading +/- to indicate signed values, 
and with no prefix to indicate unsigned values.  The prefix (+) means that the 
number has the same encoding whether treated as signed or unsigned.</p>
